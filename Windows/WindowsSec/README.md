# Windows 10

Be sure to use the included VagrantFile for initial access with default creds.

**Be sure to configure the VagrantFile before using `vagrant up` if you want to use other keys/configurations.**

**ALWAYS change the default password, and regenerate ssh keys for this box! SSH Keys are not setup by default, since OpenSSH Server is newer on Windows 10 at the time of making this, ssh keys will need to be configured manually with whatever best practice you choose to observe**
